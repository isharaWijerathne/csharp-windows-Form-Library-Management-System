## C# Library Management Application
This Windows Forms application provides a user-friendly interface for managing library resources, including books, patrons, and lending/returning transactions. Using the code-behind approach, the application integrates form events and data management in C#, handling various functionalities such as:

Adding/Editing Books and Patrons: Forms with straightforward data entry for library records.
Lending/Returning Books: Real-time tracking of borrowed books and overdue reminders.
Inventory Management: A system to categorize, search, and update library collections.
Basic Reporting: Generate summaries on borrowing trends, availability, and patron activity.
The code-behind design makes it quick to implement and adapt for additional functionality directly on each formâ€™s logic. Let me know if you want details on a particular feature or improvement tips!
